      \item{Made a prototype sensor with feedback using an Arduino to help children who walk on their toes.Patients improved after use of the device and were verified separately. Improved prototype with Custom board designed in kicad around an ATMEGA, IMU and SD card.  }
      \item{Developed an Ardunio based board for patients suffering from bed sores. The device has a small counter and alerts patients every two hours. Patients wore the sensor for three days and the data from the sensor was saved to an external SD card.}
      \item{Improved bed sore prototype with a second revision built around an nrf52, a system on chip ARM cortex-m4 with bluetooth. The new prototype provides feedback to the patient from a mobile device. Used Zephyr, an RTOS system, that offers better portability and stability over a bare Arduino kernel.}

        \item{Contributed to a large open source development community on Github which consists of over 200 contributors and gained some experience working on a large open source project with an extensive codebase that has been in development since 2011.}
        \item{Developed additional core modules to the core game play including ItemPipes and Rails. Rails was a rework of an older module and introduced an impulse constraint solver for more realistic collision. Itempipes allows for items to be transported through a network of pipes. Other module developers can take advantage of these base modules for a more cohesive play experience. }
        % \item{Rails add support for cart transport; A custom imuplse constraint solver was used to get semi-realistic collisions.}
        % \item{ItemPipes allows for items to be transported around the game world.}
        \item{Improved functionality of block families which stores a family of blocks for a for a single block and provides logic that pickes the block out from the family when placed or updated.}
        \item{Worked on configuring builds for Jenkins(CloudBees Core) and publishing artifacts }
